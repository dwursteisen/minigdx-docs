MiniGDX is a minimalist 3D Game engine based on Kotlin/Multiplatform.
A game can be created in Kotlin and deployed in a browser, on a desktop or on Android.

== Overview

Before creating your first game, check https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx-showcase[the showcase web site] and the https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx[MiniGDX code repository].

NOTE: You found a typo? a sentence is not clear?
https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx-docs/edit/master/src/docs/asciidoc/{docname}{docfilesuffix}[You can edit this documentation]

== Quick Start

- Open https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx-game-template[MiniGDX Template Repository]
- Hit the button "Use This Template"
- Clone your new project locally
- Run the command `./gradlew runJvm` (to run on desktop) or `./gradlew runJs` (to run in your browser)
- This example bellow should be displayed

++++
<div class="canvas-container">
    <canvas width="512" height="288" property="quickstart"></canvas>
</div>

Let's take a look to the game's code:

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/minigdx/docs/quick/start/CubeGame.kt[tag=cubegame]
----
<1> Load the scene of the game;
<2> Create an entity from a object of the scene;
<3> Create a system.

TIP: The source code of this quick start can be https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx-game-template/tree/main/src/commonMain/kotlin/your/game[browsed online]

MiniGDX is an https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html[entity component] based game engine.
Those entities are created, in this example, from objects of the scene.
The scene is loaded from a `protobuf` file.
This file is created using a gradle plugin using a `gltf` as source.
More information about this process are available in the <<_scene_creation>> paragraph.

Just keep in mind: this example load models from a file containing all 3D models.
Then it create all entities from this file: the camera, the light and the cube.
The component `Cube` is added only to this 3D model.
See this component as a "tag" so the `RotatingCubeSystem` do know which entities to manipulate.

Once all entities of the game are creating, the `RotatingCubeSystem` will manage the behaviours of all entities with the component `Cube`.

[source,kotlin]
----
include::{sourcedir}/com/github/minigdx/docs/quick/start/RotatingCubeSystem.kt[tag=cubegame]
----
<1> React to the user input.
If the space bar has been pressed, then start a timer;
<2> If the timer is started, then alter the scale of the current entity (here, the cube);
<3> Rotate the cube in all cases.

TIP: Tweak the cube animation by changing the speed of the rotation then restart the game using `./gradlew runJvm`

== Game Creation Workflow

=== 3D model creation

MiniGDX can load 3D model from GLTF files. But not all 3D model nor all features from GLTF are supported.
To use your model, the model needs to have a texture attached.

Only emissive Texture or  BSDF Texture are supported for the moment.

TIP: You don't want to use texture but only color? Create or download a texture on https://lospec.com/palette-listg[lospec]. This texture will act like a palette: use a pixel as color for one face for example.

WARNING: Safari doesn't support WebGL 2 for the moment. If your game needs to run under safari, you have to create
a texture with a pow2 size. This issue should be fixed with Safari 15. https://github.com/minigdx/minigdx/issues/15[More information on the related issue].

To be loaded in MiniGDX, the GLTF file needs to be converted in a protobuf file that can be read by MiniGDX.
This conversion is performed at the build time by gradle using a plugin. By default, all `gltf` files
in the `src/commonMain/assetsSource` are converted as protobuf files.

=== Use the 3D model

The `FileHandler` is responsible to load resources. When loaded at the creation of the game (1),
the resource will be fully loaded when the game will be started (2)

=== Camera

MiniGDX provide two camera type:

- Perspective: Project objects on the scream like a camera would do: An object close to the camera will be tall while the same object far in the background look small.
- Orthographic: The object will lock the same no mater if it's close or not of the camera. Ideal for a 2D game

You can switch between the two in the example bellow.
